# Jumps

The execution order of a DSL file can be changed using the `next` field, which must contain the name of the step to execute next, as its value.

It is important to note, that without the `next` field, steps will still be executed "in order" - so if a step "jumps" to another step, from there on, steps
will be executed
"in order" again (assuming those following steps don't have the `next` field).

Additionally, there is no limit to the amount of times a step can be executed - if a hypothetical `STEP A` "jumps" to another step that somehow leads back to
the already executed `STEP A`, then `STEP A` will be executed again, **and the same jump will be done again as well**.

If the user wishes to determine when the processing of a DSL should end, they can use the value `end` for the `next` field, which stops the execution of a DSL.

### Example of jump with end

[`jump-with-end.yml`](../../DSL/GET/order/jump-with-end.yml)

```
first_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
  next: second_step

third_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
  next: end

second_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
  next: third_step
```

### Example of jump over step

[`jump-over-step.yml`](../../DSL/GET/order/jump-over-step.yml)

```
first_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
  next: second_step

this_step_is_jumped_over_and_not_executed:
  call: http.get
  args:
    url: https://example.com/callB

second_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value

third_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
```

### Example of end

[`end-execution.yml`](../../DSL/GET/order/end-execution.yml)

```
first_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value

second_step:
  call: reflect.mock
  args:
    response:
      test: value
  next: end

this_step_is_not_executed:
  call: http.get
  args:
    url: https://example.com/callB
```
